Kaja,Concentrate on your breath ... Clear you mind of all thoughts ... Enter the Avatar State ...,专注于你的呼吸......清除你所有想法的思想......进入阿凡达州......
Young Roku,"Inhale ... and exhale ... I think my leg is falling asleep ... clearing mind ... I hope we're not eating komodo chicken for lunch again ... Arrggh, concentrate! I can't do it! I've been in retreat for five months and I'm no closer to mastering the Avatar State than when I arrived!",吸气......然后呼气......我想我的腿正在睡着......清醒的心情......我希望我们不再吃午餐吃科莫多鸡了......

Roku,"But I was impatient, so I decided to use the winter solstice sun to help me ...",但我很不耐烦，所以我决定用冬至来帮助我......

Roku,"Well, not exactly ...",嗯，不完全是......
Kaja,"Roku, what did you do?!",Roku，你做了什么？！
Roku,"I was stuck in the Avatar State. I could see my body, but I couldn't control it. Luckily, Fire Sage Kaja was wiser than I, and he knew how to break the Avatar State's hold on me.",我被困在阿凡达州。我能看到我的身体，但我无法控制它。幸运的是，Fire Sage Kaja比我更聪明，他知道如何打破阿凡达州对我的控制。
Young Roku,What happened? Cough! Cough!,发生了什么？咳嗽！咳嗽！
Kaja,Looks like we have a lot more training to do ... after you rebuild the temple.,看起来我们有更多的训练要做...重建寺庙后。
Roku,"I see my own impatience in you, Aang. Do not be too hard on yourself. You will master the Avatar State, as I finally did. Look for Avatar Kyoshi in the place where Hei Bai sleeps!",我看到你自己的不耐烦，Aang。不要对自己太难。你将掌握阿凡达州，就像我最终做的那样。在黑白睡觉的地方寻找阿凡达Kyoshi！
Aang,... what?,... 什么？
Aang,Hei Bai! Roku told me I'd find you here!,黑白！ Roku告诉我，我会在这里找到你！
Hei Bai,Rraaaawww!,Rraaaawww！
Aang,"I'm happy to see you too. I don't suppose you've seen Avatar Kyoshi around, have you? There she is!",我也很高兴见到你。我不认为你见过Avatar Kyoshi，对吗？她在这里！
Kyoshi,"It's nice to see you, Aang. Sorry about the whole ""wrongfully accused of murder"" thing back in Chin Village.",很高兴见到你，Aang。对于Chin Village的整个“被错误地被指控谋杀”的事情感到抱歉。
Aang,That's okay.,没关系。
Kyoshi,"After Chin the Conqueror died, I helped the world live in balance. I accomplished a lot of good, but I also made some mistakes ... One of my greatest challenges was dealing with a peasant uprising in Ba Sing Se.",征服者秦去世后，我帮助世界平衡生活。我做了很多好事，但我也犯了一些错误......我面临的最大挑战之一就是处理巴辛塞的农民起义。
Angry peasant,Down with the Earth King!,打倒地球王！
Kyoshi,"The peasants felt that the Earth King's role was outdated and that he did not represent their interests. So they stormed the Upper Ring. The peasants destroyed priceless historical artifacts and buildings - anything that represented the ""old governement ."" The Earth King summoned me to help him end the revolution.",农民认为地球王的角色已经过时，他并不代表他们的利益。所以他们冲进了上环。农民摧毁了无价的历史文物和建筑 - 任何代表“旧政府”的东西。地球王召唤我帮助他结束革命。
Earth King,"I don't care how you do it, but I want you to squash those unruly peasants!",我不在乎你是怎么做的，但是我想让你压扁那些不守规矩的农民！
Kyoshi,I won't do it.,我不会这样做。
Earth King,"How dare you defy your King! Guards, arrest Avatar Kyoshi!",你怎么敢藐视你的国王！卫兵，逮捕阿凡达Kyoshi！
Kyoshi,How dare you defy your Avatar! Are you ready to make a compromise?,你怎么敢挑战你的阿凡达！你愿意妥协吗？
Earth King,Yes ...,是的......
Kyoshi,I don't like this revolution either. But everyone in this Kingdom must have a voice if balance is to prevail over tyranny. So I propose this - you will listen to the peasants' grievances and I will protect you interests and Ba Sing Se's cultural heritage. Agreed?,我也不喜欢这场革命。但是，如果平衡胜过暴政，那么这个王国的每个人都必须有发言权。所以我提出这个问题 - 你会听取农民的不满，我会保护你们的利益和Ba Sing Se的文化遗产。同意？
Earth King,Agreed ...,同意......
Kyoshi,"I immediately set to work training an elite force of Earthbenders ... They would be silent, precise ... and feared by all. They became known as the Dai Li.",我立刻开始训练地球人的精英部队......他们会沉默，精确......并且所有人都害怕。他们被称为戴莉。
Aang,"You trained the Dai Li? But they're the worst, most corrupt Earthbenders in the world!",你培养了戴莉？但他们是世界上最糟糕，最腐败的地球人！
Kyoshi,"I thought I was doing the right thing by creating a group that protected cultural history. I had no idea what they would become. Aang, our actions always have an effect: sometimes positive, sometimes negative ... and sometimes not for many lifetimes. Hurry! You must find the Waterbender Avatar who came before me.",我认为通过建立一个保护文化历史的团体，我做的是正确的事情。我不知道他们会成为什么样的人。 Aang，我们的行为总会产生影响：有时是积极的，有时是消极的...有时甚至不会有很多生命。匆忙！你必须找到摆在我面前的Waterbender Avatar。
Aang,But I don't even know his name!,但我甚至不知道他的名字！
Kyoshi,His name is Avatar Kuruk.,他的名字是阿凡达库鲁克。
Aang,"We're in the Realm of Koh, Hei Bai ... We better be careful. Aaahh! Koh took your face and replaced it with a bear's face!",我们在Koh，黑白的境界......我们最好小心。 Aaahh！ Koh拿走了你的脸，换上了熊的脸！
Kuruk,"Relax kid. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm Avatar Kuruk! Nice to finally meet you. Now tell me, have you seen a beautiful woman with long, brown hair around here?",放松孩子。我不会伤害你的。我是阿凡达库鲁克！很高兴终于见到你了。现在告诉我，你见过一个长着棕色头发的漂亮女人吗？
Aang,"No, who is she?",不，她是谁？
Kuruk,"She's my wife. When I was a young Avatar ... ... I traveled the world, challenging other benders to tests of strength ...",她是我的妻子。当我还是一个年轻的阿凡达......我走遍世界，挑战其他弯曲者进行力量测试......
Kuruk,I challenge you to an Agni Kai!,我向你挑战Agni Kai！
Fire Nation civilian,"Uh, I was just going to the store.",呃，我刚去商店。
Kuruk,I loved impressing people with my bending prowess. Especially girls.,我喜欢用弯曲的力量给人留下深刻的印象。特别是女孩。
Kuruk,Bet you girls have never seen a lotus tornado before!,打赌你女孩以前从未见过莲花龙卷风！
Airbender girl #1,It's beautiful!,很美丽！
Airbender girl #2,"I love you, Avatar Kuruk!",我爱你，Kuruk Avatar！
Kuruk,"I was arrogant, proud, and boastful ... I never thought about settling down until I met the love of my life. We met during the New Moon Celebration, when the sister tribes would come together as one. It was love at first sight. Her name was Ummi. She was from the Southern Tribe. And she was the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen. With Ummi in my life, I decided to change my irresponsible ways and settle down.",我傲慢，自豪，自夸......在我遇到生命中的爱之前，我从没想过安定下来。我们在新月庆祝活动期间相遇，当时姐妹部落将团结在一起。那是一见钟情。她的名字是Ummi。她来自南部落。她是我见过的最美丽的女人。在我生命中的Ummi，我决定改变我不负责任的方式并安定下来。
Ummi,A betrothal necklace?,订婚项链？
Kuruk,"Ummi, will you marry me?",嗯，你愿意嫁给我吗？
Ummi,Yes!,是!
Kuruk,"We were to be married in the Spirit Oasis. But on the day of our wedding, tragedy struck.",我们将在Spirit Oasis结婚。但在婚礼当天，悲剧发生了。
Kuruk,Ummi! No!,Ummi！不！
Kuruk,"Ummi fell into the spirit pond, as if some unseen force pulled her in.",Ummi落入精神池塘，好像有些看不见的力量将她拉进来。
Kuruk,She's gone ...,她走了 ...
Kuruk,"She didn't drown. She disappeared into the Spirit World ... Koh took her to punish me for my past mistakes. Every year, on the anniversary of our wedding, I traveled to the Spirit World hoping to save my wife from Koh. But I failed.",她没有溺水。她消失在精神世界里......由于过去的错误，Koh带她去惩罚我。每年，在我们婚礼的周年纪念日，我都会前往精神世界，希望能把我的妻子从Koh那里救出来。但我失败了。
Aang,"I'm sorry. I know how that feels. Wait! I've seen her! Koh still has her! When I was in Koh's lair, he showed me Ummi's face!",对不起。我知道这感觉如何。等待！我见过她了！ Koh还有她！当我在Koh的巢穴时，他向我展示了Ummi的脸！
Kuruk,"Thank you, Aang. My search is not over yet. I will keep hunting Koh until Ummi and I are reunited. Hurry! Avatar Yangchen is waiting for you!",谢谢你，Aang。我的搜索还没有结束。我将继续寻找Koh，直到Ummi和我重聚。匆忙！阿凡达杨辰在等你！
Aang,Hello? Avatar Yangchen? Anyone here?,你好？阿凡达杨辰？有人吗？
Yangchen,"It's an honor to meet you, Aang.",很荣幸见到你，Aang。
Aang,It's been such an amazing experience to meet my past lives.,这是一次非常棒的经历，可以满足我的前世。
Yangchen,And what did you learn by meeting them?,你通过见到他们学到了什么？
Aang,Well ... I realized that no Avatar is perfect. They all struggled and made mistakes. Like me.,嗯......我意识到没有阿凡达是完美的。他们都挣扎着犯错误。像我这样的。
Yangchen,Very wise.,非常聪明。
Aang,But it made me wonder - why is the Avatar Spirit a human in every life? Wouldn't it be better if the Avatar was an all powerful spirit that never died?,但它让我想知道 - 为什么阿凡达精神在每个生命中都是人类？如果“阿凡达”是一个从未死过的强大精神，难道不是更好吗？
Yangchen,"I don't think so. The Avatar must be compassionate towards all people ... and the only way to do that is to live with them. The Avatar must experience sadness ... Anger ... Joy ... and happiness. By feeling all these emotions, it helps you understand how precious human life is ... so you will do anything to protect it. If you were an all powerful spirit living on the top of some mountain, you wouldn't have much in common with an ordinary person. So the Avatar continues to take human rebirth. And with each life, learns what it means to be human.",我不这么认为。阿凡达必须对所有人都富有同情心......而这样做的唯一方法就是和他们一起生活。阿凡达必须经历悲伤......愤怒......快乐......和快乐。通过感受所有这些情感，它可以帮助您了解人类的生命是多么宝贵......所以你会做任何事来保护它。如果你是一个生活在某座山顶上的强大精神，你就不会与一个普通人有太多共同之处。所以阿凡达继续接受人类的重生。在每一个生命中，学习人类意味着什么。
Aang,"Now that I've reconnected with all of you, does that mean the Avatar Spirit is okay?",现在我已经和你们所有人重新联系了，这是否意味着阿凡达精神还可以？
Yangchen,"Yes, but your physical body is still injured. You need time to heal. And unfortunately, it seems your ability to enter the Avatar State has been disrupted. You won't be able to rely on your past lives to help you. You must rely on your friends. And when you wake up, you won't remember this journey to the Spirit World. It will be like a forgotten dream. Until we meet again, Aang.",是的，但你的身体仍然受伤。你需要时间来治愈。不幸的是，你进入阿凡达州的能力似乎已被打乱。你将无法依靠你的前世来帮助你。你必须依靠你的朋友。当你醒来时，你将不会记得这个通往精神世界的旅程。这将是一个被遗忘的梦想。直到我们再见面，Aang。
