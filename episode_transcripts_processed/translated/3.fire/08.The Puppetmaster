Avatar Roku,Previously on Avatar ...,以前在阿凡达...
Katara,You're looking at the only waterbender in the whole South Pole. This ship has haunted my tribe when Gran-Gran was a little girl. It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks.,你正在寻找整个南极唯一的水上运动员。当Gran-Gran是一个小女孩时，这艘船困扰着我的部落。这是Fire Nation首次攻击的一部分。
Yue,"The legend said the moon was the first waterbender. Our ancestor saw how it pushed and pulled the tides, and learned how to do it themselves.",传说月亮是第一个水淹者。我们的祖先看到了它如何推动和拉动潮汐，并学会了如何自己做。

Toph,What are you doing?,你在做什么？
Katara,I'm making my own water!,我正在自己做水！
Sokka,"Suddenly, they heard something down the hall in the dark. Oooh ... It came into the torchlight ... and they knew the blade of Wing Fung was haunted! Ooh-aaah!",突然间，他们在黑暗中听到了大厅里的一些声音。噢......它进入了火炬之光......他们知道永丰的刀刃是闹鬼的！哦，AAAH！
Aang,"I think I like ""the man with a sword for a hand"" better.",我觉得我更喜欢“有一把剑的男人”。
Toph,Water Tribe slumber parties must stink.,水部落睡衣派对必须发臭。
Katara,"No, wait! I've got one! And this is a true Southern Water Tribe story.",不，等等！我有一个！这是一个真正的南部水族部落的故事。

Katara,"No, it happened to Mom.",不，它发生在妈妈身上。
Katara,"One winter when Mom was a girl, a snowstorm buried the whole village for weeks. A month later, Mom noticed she hadn't seen her friend Nini since the storm. So Mom and some others went to check on Nini's family. When they got there, no one was home. Just a fire flickering in the fireplace. While the men went out to search, Mom stayed in the house. When she was alone, she heard a voice. ""It's so cold and I can't get warm!"" Mom turned and saw Nini standing by the fire. She was blue like she was frozen. Mom ran outside for help, but when everyone came back, Nini was gone.",一个冬天，妈妈还是个女孩，一场暴风雪将整个村庄埋葬了好几个星期。一个月后，妈妈注意到自风暴以来她没有见过她的朋友妮妮。所以妈妈和其他一些人去检查Nini的家人。当他们到达那里时，没有人在家。只是在壁炉里闪烁的火焰。当男人出去搜寻时，妈妈留在了房子里。当她独自一人时，她听到了一个声音。 “天气很冷，我不能暖和！”妈妈转身看见妮妮站在火堆旁。她很冷，就像她被冻结一样。妈妈跑到外面寻求帮助，但当大家回来时，妮妮走了。
Sokka,Where'd she go?,她去哪儿了？
Katara,"No one knows. Nini's house stands empty to this day, but sometimes, people see smoke coming up from the chimney, like little Nini is still trying to get warm.",没人知道。 Nini的房子到目前为止空无一人，但有时候，人们看到烟囱里冒出烟雾，就像小妮妮仍然想要变暖一样。

Katara,That's ridiculous. She's a nice woman who took us in and gave us a place to stay. She kinda reminds me of Gran-Gran.,这是荒谬的。她是一个好女人，带我们进去，给了我们一个住宿的地方。她有点让我想起Gran-Gran。
Sokka,"But what did she mean by that comment, ""mysterious children""?",但她的意思是什么，“神秘的孩子”？
Katara,"Gee, I don't know. Maybe because she found four strange kids camping in the woods at night? Isn't that a little mysterious?",哎呀，我不知道。也许是因为她发现四个奇怪的孩子晚上在树林里露营？这不是有点神秘吗？

Ding,"Didn't see no spirit, just felt something come over me, like I was possessed. Forced me to start walking toward the mountain. I tried to fight it, but I couldn't control my own limbs.

I just high-tailed it away from that mountain as quick as I could!",没有看到没有精神，只是觉得有什么东西来到我身边，就像我被附身一样。迫使我开始走向山。我试图对抗它，但我无法控制自己的四肢。它只是让我进入那里的洞穴。我抬头看着月亮，想到了我最后一瞥光明的样子。但是太阳开始升起，我再次掌控了自己！我尽可能快地把它从那座山上拖了下来！

Hama,"What I'm about to show you, I discovered in that wretched Fire Nation prison.",我要告诉你的是，我在那个可怜的火国家监狱里发现了。
Hama,"The guards were always very careful to keep any water away from us. They piped in dry air and had us suspended away from the ground. Before giving us any water, they would bind our hands and feet so we couldn't bend. Any sign of trouble was met with cruel retribution. And yet each month, I felt the full moon enriching me with its energy. There had to be something I could do to escape. Then I realized that where there is life, there is water. The rats that scurried across the floor of my cage were nothing more than skins filled with liquid and I passed years developing the skill that would lead to my escape. Bloodbending. Controlling the water in another body, enforcing your own will over theirs. Once I had mastered the rats, I was ready for the men.",警卫总是非常小心地让我们远离水。他们在干燥的空气中吹笛，让我们悬挂在地上。在给我们任何水之前，它们会束缚我们的手脚，所以我们无法弯曲。任何麻烦的迹象都遭到残酷的报复。然而每个月，我都感受到满月使我的精力充实。我必须做些什么才能逃脱。然后我意识到有生命的地方有水。匆匆穿过我笼子的地板的老鼠只不过是装满液体的皮肤，而且我多年来一直在开发能够导致我逃跑的技能。 Bloodbending。控制另一个身体的水，强制执行他们自己的意志。一旦掌握了老鼠，我就为男人们做好了准备。
Hama,"And during the next full moon, I walked free for the first time in decades. My cell unlocked by the very guards assigned to keep me in. Once you perfect this technique, you can control anything or anyone.",在接下来的满月期间，我几十年来第一次自由行走。我的牢房被指派给我的守卫解锁了。一旦你完善了这项技术，你就可以控制任何人或任何人。
Katara,But ... to reach inside someone and control them? I don't know if I want that kind of power.,但是......到达某人并控制他们？我不知道我是否想要那种力量。
Hama,"The choice is not yours. The power exists. And it's your duty to use the gifts you've been given to win this war. Katara, they tried to wipe us out, our entire culture, your mother!",选择不是你的。权力存在。你有责任使用你所获得的礼物来赢得这场战争。卡塔拉，他们试图把我们，我们的整个文化，你的母亲！
Katara,I know.,我知道。
Hama,"Then you should understand what I'm talking about! We're the last two waterbenders of the Southern Tribe. We have to fight these people whenever we can, wherever they are, with any means necessary!",然后你应该明白我在说什么！我们是南部落的最后两个水上运动员。无论何时何地，我们都必须以任何必要的方式与这些人作斗争！
Katara,It's you ... You're the one who's been making people disappear during the full moons!,这是你......你是那个让人们在满月期间消失的人！
Hama,"They threw me in prison to rot, along with my brothers and sisters! They deserve the same! You must carry on my work!",他们和我的兄弟姐妹一起把我扔在监狱里腐烂了！他们应该得到同样的！你必须继续我的工作！
Katara,I won't! I won't use bloodbending and I won't allow you to keep terrorizing this town!,我不会！我不会使用血腥，我不会让你继续恐吓这个城镇！
Hama,"You should've learned the technique before you turned against me! It's impossible to fight your way out of my grip! I control every muscle, every vein in your body!",在你反对我之前，你应该学会这种技巧！这是不可能战胜你的方式！我控制着你身体的每一块肌肉，每一根脉！
Katara,Stop! Please ...,停止！请 ...
Katara,"You're not the only one who draws power from the moon! My bending is more powerful than yours, Hama. Your technique is useless on me!",你不是唯一一个从月球中获取力量的人！哈马，我的弯曲比你的更强大。你的技术对我没用！
Hama,Aahhh!,Aahhhh！
Sokka,"We know what you've been doing, Hama!",我们知道你一直在做什么，哈马！
Aang,Give up! You're outnumbered!,放弃！你的人数超过了！
Hama,No! You've outnumbered yourselves.,没有！你的数量超过了你自己。
Sokka,"Katara, look out! It's like my brain has a mind of its own! Stop it arm, stop it!",卡塔拉，小心！这就像我的大脑有自己的想法！停下手臂，停下来！
Aang,This feels weird!,这感觉很奇怪！
Katara,"I'm sorry, Aang!",对不起，Aang！
Aang,It's okay!,没关系！
Hama,"Don't hurt your friends, Katara! And don't let them hurt each other!",不要伤害你的朋友，卡塔拉！不要让他们互相伤害！
Katara,No!,没有！
Male prisoner #1,You're going to be locked away forever.,你将永远被锁定。
Hama,"My work is done. Congratulations, Katara. You're a bloodbender.",我的工作已经完成。恭喜，卡塔拉。你是一个血腥的人。
