Zuko,"No, I've learned everything! And I've had to learn it on my own! Growing up, we were taught that the Fire Nation was the greatest civilization in history. And somehow, the War was our way of sharing our greatness with the rest of the world. What an amazing lie that was. The people of the world are terrified by the Fire Nation.

And if we don't want the world to destroy itself , we need to replace it with an era of peace and kindness.",不，我已经学到了一切！而且我必须自己学习它！在成长过程中，我们被告知火之国是历史上最伟大的文明。不知何故，战争是我们与世界其他地方分享我们伟大的方式。真是个奇怪的谎言。世界人民被火国家吓坏了。他们看不到我们的伟大。他们讨厌我们！我们应得的！我们在世界上创造了一个恐惧的时代。如果我们不希望世界毁灭自己，我们需要以和平与善良的时代取而代之。

Toph,You're trying to keep us here and waste all our time!,你想把我们留在这里浪费我们所有的时间！
Azula,"Um, right, I think your friend just said that, genius. And since you can't see, I should tell you I'm rolling my eyes.",嗯，对，我觉得你的朋友刚才说，天才。既然你看不见，我应该告诉你，我正在翻白眼。

Zuko,But I've come to an even more important decision. I'm going to join the Avatar and I'm going to help him defeat you.,但我做出了一个更重要的决定。我要加入阿凡达，我会帮他打败你。
Ozai,"Really? Since you're a full-blown traitor now and you want me gone, why wait? I'm powerless. You've got your swords. Why don't you just do it now?",真？既然你现在是一个成熟的叛徒，你想要我走了，为什么要等？我无能为力你有你的剑。你为什么不现在就这样做？

Ozai,"My father, Fire Lord Azulon, had commanded me to do the unthinkable to you, my own son, and I was going to do it. Your mother found out and swore she would protect you at any cost.

Zuko,So she's alive?,她还活着吗？
Ozai,Perhaps. Now I realize that banishment is far too merciful a penalty for treason. Your penalty will be far steeper.,也许。现在我意识到放逐是对叛国罪的惩罚。你的处罚会更加苛刻。
Azula,"Oh, sounds like the firebending's back on.",哦，听起来就像是火焰重燃。
Azula,Dad's all the way at the end of the hall then down a secret stairway on the left. I'm sure he'd be more than happy to see you now.,爸爸一直走在大厅的尽头，然后沿着左边的一个秘密楼梯走下去。我相信他现在非常乐意见到你。

Aang,I guess you guys are right.,我猜你们是对的。
Sokka,You'll have another chance. I know you will.,你还有机会。我知道你会的。
Bato,"What should we do, Hakoda? Shouldn't something have happened by now?",我们该怎么办，Hakoda？现在不应该发生什么事吗？
Hakoda,"I don't know. But now that the eclipse is over, I expect we're going to see some firebenders any minute.",我不知道。但是现在日食已经结束了，我希望我们会在任何时候看到一些火炬手。
Mechanist,"My own invention. Oh, this is terrible!",我自己的发明。哦，这太糟糕了！
Katara,They're back!,他们回来了！
Sokka,"It was all a trap! Azula knew we were coming and she's plotted out every move! We've just got to get to the beach as fast as we can. If we can make it to the submarines, maybe we can get away safely.",这都是陷阱！ Azula知道我们要来了，她的每一步动作都被画出来了！我们必须尽可能快地到达海滩。如果我们能够潜入潜艇，也许我们可以安全逃离。
