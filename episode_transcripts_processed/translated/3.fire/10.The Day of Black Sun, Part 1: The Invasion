To gain sea access to the Fire Nation capital, we need to get past our first major obstacle here, The Great Gates of Azulon. Next, we hit the land, and we hit hard.

At that point, the eclipse will begin.",谢谢你，Sokka。没关系，你为什么不休息一下？让我为每个人澄清几点。今天是黑太阳的日子，我要感谢大家的自我牺牲和勇气。入侵有两个步骤，一个海军阶段，然后一个陆地阶段。为了进入Fire Nation首都的海上通道，我们需要通过我们的第一个主要障碍，即Azulon的Great Gates。接下来，我们击中了土地，我们受了重创。我们必须战胜他们的城垛并保护广场塔。一旦我们这样做，就由皇宫决定。那时，日食将开始。
