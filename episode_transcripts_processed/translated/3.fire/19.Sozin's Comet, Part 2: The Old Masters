If I had been more decisive and acted sooner, I could have stopped Sozin and stopped the war before it started. I offer you this wisdom, Aang: You must be decisive.",在我的生活中，我试图受到纪律处分并表现出克制，但当Fire Lord Sozin利用我的克制和怜悯时，它却适得其反。如果我更加果断并且行动得更快，我本可以阻止索津并在战争开始之前停止战争。我向你提供这种智慧，Aang：你必须果断。

But then, I lost the woman I loved to Koh, the Face Stealer. It was my fault. If I had been more attentive and more active, I could've saved her. Aang, you must actively shape your own destiny and the destiny of the world.",我是阿凡达库鲁克。当我年轻的时候，我总是像阿凡达一样流氓。人们似乎解决了自己的问题，世界上有和平与美好的时光。但是后来，我失去了我喜欢的女人，脸上的偷窃者。这都怪我。如果我更专注，更活跃，我就能救她。 Aang，你必须积极塑造自己的命运和世界的命运。

Aang,All these past Avatars. They keep telling me I'm gonna have to do it. They don't get it. You're right. Maybe an Air Nomad Avatar will understand where I'm coming from. I know you can't really talk. Pretending you can just helps me think.

Here is my wisdom for you: Selfless duty calls you to sacrifice your own spiritual needs, and do whatever it takes to protect the world.",许多伟大而聪明的空中游牧民族已经脱离了自己并获得了精神启蒙，但阿凡达却永远无法做到。因为你的唯一职责是走向世界。以下是我对你的智慧：无私的责任要求你牺牲自己的属灵需要，尽一切可能保护世界。
Aang,"I guess I don't have a choice, Momo. I have to kill the Fire Lord.",我想我没有选择，莫莫。我必须杀死火神。
Zuko,"Uncle, I know you must have mixed feelings about seeing me. But I want you to know, I am so, so, sorry, Uncle. I am so sorry and ashamed of what I did.

History would see it as just more senseless violence, a brother killing a brother to grab power. The only way for this war to end peacefully is for the Avatar to defeat the Fire Lord.",即使我击败了Ozai，我也不知道我能做到，但结束战争将是错误的方式。历史会把它视为更无谓的暴力，一个兄弟杀死一个兄弟夺取权力。这场战争以和平方式结束的唯一方法是让阿凡达战胜火神。
Zuko,And then ... then you would come and take your rightful place on the throne?,然后......那么你会来宝座上占据你应有的位置吗？

Only now do I see that my destiny is to take it back from the Fire Nation, so the Earth Kingdom can be free again.",Sozin的彗星到了，我们的命运就在我们身上。 Aang将面对Fire Lord。当我还是一个男孩的时候，我有一个愿景，我有一天会把Ba Sing Se带走。只有现在我才能看到我的命运是从火国带回来，所以地球王国可以再次自由。

Sokka,"Thank you, Master.",谢谢你，师父。
Zuko,"So if I'm going to be Fire Lord after the war is over, what are you going to do?",所以，如果战争结束后我将成为Fire Lord，你打算做什么？
Iroh,"After I re-conquer Ba Sing Se, I'm going to re-conquer my tea shop, and I'm going to play Pai Sho every day.",在我重新征服Ba Sing Se之后，我将重新征服我的茶叶店，而且我每天都会去玩Pai Sho。

Since beginning-less time, darkness thrives in the void but always yields to purifying light.",真正的头脑可以在不丢失的情况下度过所有的谎言和幻想。真正的心脏可以在不受伤害的情况下强化仇恨的毒药。从没有开始的时间开始，黑暗在空虚中茁壮成长，但总是产生净化光。

Ozai,"It's time for this world to end in fire, and for a new world to be born from the ashes.",现在是时候让这个世界以火焰结束，并从灰烬中诞生一个新的世界。
