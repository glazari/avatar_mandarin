Zuko,Why are you telling me this?,你为什么这么告诉我？
Iroh,"Because understanding the struggle between your two great-grandfathers can help you better understand the battle within yourself. Evil and good are always at war inside you, Zuko. It is your nature, your legacy. But, there is a bright side. What happened generations ago can be resolved now, by you. Because of your legacy, you alone can cleanse the sins of our family and the Fire Nation. Born in you, along with all the strife, is the power to restore balance to the world.",因为了解两位曾祖父之间的斗争可以帮助你更好地理解你内心的战斗。 Zuko，邪恶和善良总是在你内心的战争中。这是你的天性，你的遗产。但是，有一个光明的一面。几代人以前发生的事情现在可以由你解决。由于你的遗产，你一个人可以清除我们家庭和火国的罪恶。出生在你身上，伴随着所有纷争，是恢复世界平衡的力量。

Sokka,Then what was the point?,那有什么意义呢？
Aang,"Roku was just as much Fire Nation as Sozin was, right? If anything, their story proves anyone's capable of great good and great evil. Everyone, even the Fire Lord and the Fire Nation have to be treated like they're worth giving a chance. And I also think it was about friendships.",Roku和Sozin一样和Fire Nation一样，对吧？如果有的话，他们的故事证明任何人都有能力做大善恶。每个人，甚至火之王和火之国都必须得到对待，就像他们值得给予机会一样。我也认为这是关于友谊的。
Toph,Do you really think friendships can last more than one lifetime?,你真的认为友谊可以持续超过一生吗？
Aang,I don't see why not.,我不明白为什么不。
Sokka,"Well, scientifically speaking, there's no way to prove that ...",那么，从科学上讲，没有办法证明......
Katara,"Oh, Sokka, just hold hands.",哦，Sokka，只是牵着手。
