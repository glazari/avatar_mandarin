Toph,"They were blind, just like me. So we understood each other. I was able to learn earthbending, not just as a martial art, but as an extension of my senses. For them, the original earthbenders, it wasn't just about fighting. It was their way of interacting with the world.",他们是盲人，就像我一样。所以我们互相理解。我能够学习冥想，不仅仅是作为一种武术，而是作为我感官的延伸。对他们来说，原始的地球人，不仅仅是战斗。这是他们与世界互动的方式。

Aang,"I learned from the monks, but the original airbenders were the sky bison. Maybe you can give me a lesson sometime, buddy.",我从僧侣那里学到了东西，但最初的空降兵是天空野牛。也许你可以在某个时候给我一个教训，伙计。

Aang,"Sun Warriors? Well, I know they weren't around when I was a kid.",太阳勇士？好吧，我知道我小时候他们不在身边。
Zuko,"No, they died off thousands of years ago. But their civilization wasn't too far from where we are now. Maybe we can learn something by poking around their ruins.",不，他们几千年前就死了。但他们的文明与我们现在所处的距离并不太远。也许我们可以通过探索废墟来学习一些东西。

Sokka,"So, what? Maybe you'll pick up some super old Sun Warrior energy just by standing where they stood a thousand years ago?",所以呢？也许你会站在一千年前的地方，拿起一些超级老太阳战士的能量？
Zuko,"More or less. Either I find a new way to firebend, or the Avatar has to find a new teacher.",或多或少。要么我找到了一种新的火焰方式，要么阿凡达必须找到一位新教师。
Zuko,"We've been riding for hours. I don't know why, but I thought this thing would be a lot faster.",我们骑了好几个小时。我不知道为什么，但我认为这件事会快得多。

Aang,"Zuko, I think the past is trying to kill me.",Zuko，我认为过去是想杀了我。
Zuko,I can't believe it. This booby trap must be centuries old and it still works.,我简直不敢相信。这个诱杀陷阱必须有几个世纪的历史，它仍然有效。
Aang,There's probably a lot more. Maybe this means we shouldn't be here.,可能还有很多。也许这意味着我们不应该在这里。
Zuko,"Where's that up-beat attitude you were talkin' about? Besides, people don't make traps unless they've got something worth protecting.",你在谈论的那种优势态度在哪里？此外，除非他们有值得保护的东西，否则人们不会陷阱。
Aang,"Look, this seems promising. Though I'm not sure what this tells us about the original source of firebending.",看，这看起来很有希望。虽然我不确定这会告诉我们最初的火灾来源。

The last great dragon was conquered long before I was born, by my uncle.",他开始狩猎龙的传统以获得荣耀。有最终的firebenders。如果你能征服一个人，那么你的火力天赋就会成为传奇，你将获得荣誉称号，龙。我的叔叔，在我出生之前很久就征服了最后一条巨龙。
Aang,"But I thought your uncle was ... I don't know, good?",但我以为你的叔叔是......我不知道，好吗？
Zuko,"He had a complicated past. Family tradition, I guess. Let's just move on.",他有一个复杂的过去。我想是家庭传统。让我们继续吧。
Aang,It's locked up!,它被锁定了！
Zuko,"Wait. It's a celestial calendar. Just like the Fire Sages have in their temples. I bet that sunstone opens the door, but only when sunlight hits at just the right angle. On the solstice.",等待。这是一个天体日历。就像火圣贤在他们的太阳穴中一样。我打赌太阳石会打开门，但只有当阳光照射到正确的角度时才会打开。在冬至。
Aang,Monkeyfeathers! The solstice again? We can't wait here that long.,Monkeyfeathers！至日了吗？我们不能在这等很久。

Zuko,"My name is Zuko, Crown Prince of the Fire Nation. O-or at least I used to be. I know my people have distorted the ways of firebending, to be fueled by anger and rage.

Please, teach us.",我的名字是火国家的王储Zuko。 O-或者至少我曾经是。我知道我的人民已经扭曲了火灾的方式，被愤怒和愤怒所推动。但现在我想学习真正的方式，原始方式。当我们来到这里时，我从没想过太阳战士的文明是秘密活着的。在你面前，我真的很谦卑。请教我们

Sun Warrior chief,"Yes. They judged you, and gave you visions of the meaning of firebending.",是。他们对你进行评判，并向你展示了火灾的意义。

Sun Warrior chief,"Well, our civilization is called the Sun Warriors ... so yeah.",好吧，我们的文明被称为太阳勇士...所以是的。

But now, I have a new drive. I have to help you defeat my father and restore balance to the world.",这就是为什么我的火焰之前如此虚弱。因为这么多年来，狩猎你是我的动力......这是我的目的。所以，当我加入你时，我看不到内心的火焰。但现在，我有一个新的驱动器。我必须帮助你击败我的父亲并恢复世界的平衡。
