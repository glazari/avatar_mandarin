Ty Lee,"Sorry, Zuko, I ...",对不起，Zuko，我......
Zuko,"For so long I thought that if my dad accepted me, I'd be happy. I'm back home now, my dad talks to me. Ha! He even thinks I'm a hero. Everything should be perfect, right? I should be happy now, but I'm not. I'm angrier than ever and I don't know why!",很久以来我一直以为如果我爸爸接受了我，我会很高兴。我现在回到家了，爸爸跟我说话。哈！他甚至认为我是英雄。一切都应该是完美的，对吧？我现在应该开心，但我不是。我比以前更生气，我不知道为什么！

Azula,"Well, yes, I guess you're right. I don't have sob stories like all of you. I could sit here and complain how our mom liked Zuko more than me, but I don't really care. My own mother thought I was a monster. She was right, of course, but it still hurt.",嗯，是的，我想你是对的。我没有像你们所有人一样的呜咽故事。我可以坐在这里抱怨我们的妈妈比我更喜欢Zuko，但我并不在乎。我自己的母亲认为我是一个怪物。当然，她是对的，但它仍然受到伤害。
