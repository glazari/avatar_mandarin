Well, you've seen it, you know, when I was attacking you. Uhhh ... yeah, I guess I should apologize for that. But anyway, I'm good now. I mean, I thought I was good before, but I realize I was bad, but anyway, I think it's time I joined your group and taught the Avatar firebending. Well, what's your answer? Yeah ... that's what I'd say, too. How am I supposed to convince these people that I'm on their side? What would Uncle do? Zuko, you have to look within yourself to save yourself from your other self. Only then will your true self, reveal itself. Even when I'm talking for him I can't figure out what he means. What would Azula do? Listen, Avatar, I can join your group, or I can do something unspeakably horrible to you and your friends. Your choice. I guess I'm just not that good at impersonations.",你好...... Zuko在这里，但我想你可能已经认识我了。嗯......所以，事情是我有很多火灾经验，我被认为是相当擅长的。嗯，你知道，当我攻击你的时候，你已经看到了它。呃......是的，我想我应该为此道歉。但无论如何，我现在很好。我的意思是，我以前认为自己很好，但我意识到自己很糟糕，但无论如何，我认为是时候加入你的小组并教授阿凡达的火灾。那么，你的答案是什么？是的......那就是我所说的。我怎么能说服这些人我在他们身边呢？叔叔会做什么？ Zuko，你必须在自己内部寻找能够让自己远离自己。只有这样，你的真实自我才会显露出来。即使我在和他说话，我也无法弄明白他的意思。 Azula会做什么？听着，阿凡达，我可以加入你的团队，或者我可以为你和你的朋友做一些无法形容的事情。你的选择。我想我只是不善于模仿。

Katara,"No, we won't! Get out of here, and don't come back! And if we ever see you again, well, we'd better not see you again!",不，我们不会！离开这里，不要回来！如果我们再次见到你，那么，我们最好不要再见到你了！
Zuko,"Uggh! I can't believe how stupid I am! I mean, what was I thinking? Telling them I sent an assassin after them? Why didn't I just say Azula did that? They would have believed that! Stupid! Uggh!",Uggh！我简直不敢相信我有多愚蠢！我的意思是，我在想什么？告诉他们我跟他们发了一个刺客？为什么我不说Azula那样做？他们会相信的！笨！ Uggh！

Aang,I kind of have a confession to make. Remember when you two were sick and I got captured by Zhao?,我有点忏悔。还记得当你们两个病了，我被赵俘获了吗？
Sokka,And you made us suck on frozen frogs? How could I forget? I had a wart on the flap that hangs down from the back of my throat for a month!,而你让我们吮吸冷冻青蛙？我怎么会忘记？我的襟翼上有一个疣，从我的喉咙后面垂下一个月！

But I'm realizing that I had to go through all those things to learn the truth. I thought I had lost my honor, and that somehow, my father could return it to me. But I know now that no one can give you your honor. It's something you earn for yourself, by choosing to do what's right. All I want to do now is play my part in ending this war, and I know my destiny is to help you restore balance to the world. I'm sorry for what I did to you. It was an accident. Fire can be dangerous and wild, so as a firebender, I need to be more careful and control my bending, so I don't hurt people unintentionally.",听着，我知道我昨天没有很好地解释自己，在过去的几年里我经历了很多，而且很难。但我意识到我必须经历所有这些事情来了解真相。我以为我失去了我的荣誉，不知怎的，我的父亲可以把它归还给我。但我现在知道，没有人能给你你的荣誉。这是你通过选择做正确的事情为自己赚取的。我现在想做的就是发挥我的作用，结束这场战争，我知道我的命运是帮助你恢复世界的平衡。对不起我对你所做的一切。这是一次意外。火可能是危险和狂野的，所以作为一个火炬，我需要更加小心并控制我的弯曲，所以我不会无意中伤害人。
Aang,"I think you are supposed to be my firebending teacher. When I first tried to learn firebending, I burned Katara, and after that, I never wanted to firebend again. But now I know you understand how easy it is to hurt the people you love. I'd like you to teach me.",我想你应该是我的火焰老师。当我第一次尝试学习火焰时，我烧了Katara，之后，我再也不想再开火了。但现在我知道你明白伤害你爱的人是多么容易。我希望你教我。
Zuko,Thank you. I'm so happy you've accepted me into your group.,谢谢。我很高兴你接受我进入你的小组。

Katara,"You might have everyone else here buying your ... transformation, but you and I both know you've struggled with doing the right thing in the past. So let me tell you something, right now. You make one step backward, one slip-up, give me one reason to think you might hurt Aang, and you won't have to worry about your destiny anymore. Because I'll make sure your destiny ends ... right then and there. Permanently.",你可能让其他人在这里购买你的......转型，但是你和我都知道你过去一直在做正确的事情。那么现在让我告诉你一些事情。你向后退了一步，一次失误，给我一个理由认为你可能会伤害Aang，你不必再担心自己的命运了。因为我会确保你的命运结束......就在那时。永久性。
