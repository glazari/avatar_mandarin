Aang,"Today's the day! Can you believe it? After all that time searching for a teacher, I'm finally starting earthbending! And this place, it's perfect, don't you think? Sokka? Oh, you're still sleeping, huh? Sorry.",今天是今天！你相信吗？经过一段时间寻找老师，我终于开始了！这个地方，它是完美的，你不觉得吗？ Sokka？哦，你还在睡觉，对吧？抱歉。
Toph,"Goooood morning, earthbending student!",Goooood早上，地球学生！
Aang,"Good morning, Sifu Toph.",早上好，Sifu Toph。
Katara,"Hey, you never called me Sifu Katara.",嘿，你从来没有叫我Sifu Katara。
Aang,"Well, if you think I should ...",好吧，如果你认为我应该......
Toph,"Sorry, Snoozles, we'll do our earthbending as quietly as we can.",对不起，Snoozles，我们会尽可能安静地做我们的地球弯曲。
Aang,"So what move are you going to teach me first? Rock-a-lanche? The Trembler? Oh, maybe I could learn to make a whirlpool out of land!",那么你要先教我什么招？摇滚-A-拦车？颤抖？哦，也许我可以学习用土地做一个漩涡！
Toph,Let's start with ... move a rock.,让我们从......开始摇滚吧。
Aang,"Sounds good, sounds good!",听起来不错，听起来不错！
Toph,"The key to earthbending is your stance. You've got to be steady and strong. Rock is a stubborn element. If you're going to move it, you've got to be like a rock yourself.",地球弯曲的关键是你的立场。你必须保持稳定和强壮。摇滚是一种顽固的元素。如果你要移动它，你必须自己就像一块石头。
Aang,Like a rock. Got it.,就像一块石头。得到它了。
Toph,"Good. Now the actual motion of this one is pretty simple. Okay, you ready to give it a try?",好。现在这个的实际动作非常简单。好的，你准备好试一试吗？
Aang,I'm ready.,我准备好了。
Sokka,Rock beats airbender!,Rock击败airbender！
Lu Ten,"I got you, Dad!",爸爸，我找到了你！
Iroh,"My beloved Lu Ten, I will see you again.",亲爱的陆十，我会再见到你。
Zuko,Uncle ... you were unconscious. Azula did this to you. It was a surprise attack.,叔叔......你失去知觉了。 Azula对你做了这件事。这是一次突然袭击。
Iroh,"Somehow, that's not so surprising.",不知何故，这并不令人惊讶。
Zuko,I hope I made it the way you like it.,我希望我按你喜欢的方式做到。
Iroh,Good. That was very ... uhhh ... bracing.,好。那非常......呃...支撑。
Zuko,"So Uncle, I've been thinking. It's only a matter of time before I run into Azula again. I'm going to need to know more advanced firebending if I want to stand a chance against her. I know what you're going to say: she's my sister and I should be trying to get along with her.",叔叔，我一直在想。我再次遇到Azula只是时间问题。如果我想对她有机会，我将需要知道更高级的防火。我知道你要说什么：她是我的妹妹，我应该努力与她相处。
Iroh,"No, she's crazy, and she needs to go down. It's time to resume your training.",不，她很疯狂，她需要下台。是时候恢复训练了。
Katara,I don't understand what went wrong. He did it exactly the way you did.,我不明白出了什么问题。他完全按照你的方式做到了。
Aang,Maybe there's another way ... what if I came at the boulder from another angle?,也许还有另一种方式......如果我从另一个角度来到巨石怎么办？
Toph,"No. That's the problem. You've got to stop thinking like an airbender. There's no different angle, no clever solution, no trickety-trick that's going to move that rock. You've got to face it head on. And when I say head on, I mean like this ...",不，那就是问题所在。你必须像气垫一样停止思考。没有不同的角度，没有聪明的解决方案，也没有什么特技可以移动那块石头。你必须面对它。当我说出来时，我的意思是这样......
Aang,Whoa!,哇！
Katara,"I've been training Aang for a while now. He really responds well to a positive teaching experience. Lots of encouragement and praise. Kind words. If he's doing something wrong, maybe a gentle nudge in the right direction.",我已经训练了Aang一段时间了。他对积极的教学经验反应良好。很多鼓励和赞美。美言。如果他做错了什么，可能会朝着正确的方向轻轻推动。
Toph,"Thanks, Katara. A gentle nudge. I'll try that. Keep your knees high, Twinkle Toes!",谢谢，卡塔拉。温柔的轻推。我会试试的。让你的膝盖保持高度，Twinkle Toes！
Toph,Rock-like!,像石头一样！
Toph,Rock-like!,像石头一样！
Sokka,"You're awfully cute, but unfortunately you're made of meat. Just a bit closer ... Gotcha! You are one lucky little meat creature.",你非常可爱，但不幸的是你是用肉做的。稍近一点......好了！你是一个幸运的小肉类生物。
Iroh,"Lightning is a pure form of firebending, without aggression. It is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is. Some call lightning the cold-blooded fire. It is precise and deadly, like Azula. To perform the technique requires peace of mind.",闪电是一种纯粹的火焰形态，没有侵略性。其他火灾的方式并没有因愤怒或情绪而加剧。有人称闪电为冷血。它像Azula一样精确而致命。执行该技术需要高枕无忧。
Zuko,"I see. That's why we're drinking tea, to calm the mind.",我知道了。这就是为什么我们喝茶，平息心灵的原因。
Iroh,"Oh yeah, good point! I mean, yes. There is energy all around us. The energy is both yin and yang. Positive energy and negative energy. Only a select few firebenders can separate these energies. This creates an imbalance. The energy wants to restore balance, and in a moment the positive and negative energy come crashing back together, you provide release and guidance, creating lightning.",哦，是的，好点！我的意思是，是的。我们周围都有能量。能量既是阴阳也是阴阳。正能量和负能量。只有少数几个firebenders可以分离这些能量。这造成了不平衡。能量想要恢复平衡，在一瞬间，正面和负面的能量一起崩溃，你提供释放和指导，制造闪电。
Zuko,I'm ready to try it!,我准备尝试了！
Iroh,"Remember, once you separate the energy, you do not command it. You are simply its humble guide. Breathe first.",请记住，一旦你分开能量，你就不会命令它。你只是它简陋的指南。先呼吸。
Toph,"This time we're going to try something a little different. Instead of moving a rock, you're going to stop a rock. Get in your horse stance! I'm going to roll that boulder down at you. If you have the attitude of an earthbender, you'll stay in your stance and stop the rock. Like this!",这次我们要尝试一些不同的东西。你不会移动岩石，而是要阻挡岩石。马上站立！我打算把那块巨石砸向你。如果你有一个地球人的态度，你将保持你的立场，并停止岩石。像这样！
Katara,"Sorry Toph, but are you really sure this is the way to teach Aang earthbending?",对不起Toph，但你真的确定这是教Aang earthbending的方法吗？
Toph,"I'm glad you said something. Actually there is a better way. This way, you'll actually have to sense the vibrations of the boulder to stop it. Thank you, Katara.",我很高兴你说了些什么。实际上还有更好的方法。这样，你实际上必须感觉到巨石的振动才能阻止它。谢谢，卡塔拉。
Aang,"Yeah, thanks, Katara!",是的，谢谢，卡塔拉！
Katara,Heh.,嘿。
Aang,I guess I just panicked. I don't know what to say.,我猜我只是惊慌失措。我不知道该说些什么。
Toph,"There's nothing to say, you blew it! You had a perfect stance, and a perfect form. But when it came right down to it, you didn't have the guts!",没什么可说的，你吹了！你有一个完美的姿态，一个完美的形式。但是当它出现时，你没有勇气！
Aang,I know. I'm sorry.,我知道。对不起。
Toph,"Yeah, you are sorry! If you're not tough enough to stop the rock, then you can at least give it the pleasure of smashing you instead of jumping out of the way like a jelly-boned wimp! Now, do you have what it takes to face that rock like an earthbender?",是的，你很抱歉！如果你没有足够强硬来阻挡岩石，那么你至少可以给它砸碎你的乐趣，而不是像果冻懦弱的懦夫一样跳出来！现在，你有没有像面对地球那样面对那块岩石的东西？
Aang,"No, I don't think I do.",不，我不认为我这样做。
Katara,"Aang, it's no big deal. You'll take a break and try earthbending again when you're ready. Besides, you still have a lot of waterbending to work on. Okay?",Aang，没什么大不了的。当你准备好的时候，你会休息一下并再试一次。此外，你仍然需要做很多浇水工作。好的？
Aang,"Yeah, that sounds good.",是的，听起来不错。
Toph,"Yeah, whatever, go splash around until you feel better.",是的，无论如何，去你的周围，直到你感觉更好。
Zuko,Why can't I do it? Instead of lightning it keeps exploding in my face ... like everything always does.,为什么我不能这样做？而不是闪电，它不断在我的脸上爆炸...就像一切都在做。
Iroh,I was afraid this might happen. You will not be able to master lightning until you have dealt with the turmoil inside you.,我担心这可能会发生。在处理了你内心的混乱之前，你将无法掌握闪电。
Zuko,What turmoil?,动荡不安？
Iroh,"Zuko, you must let go of your feelings of shame if you want your anger to go away.",Zuko，如果你想让你的愤怒消失，你必须放下你的羞耻感。
Zuko,But I don't feel any shame at all. I'm as proud as ever.,但我一点也不感到羞耻。我一如既往地自豪。
Iroh,"Prince Zuko, pride is not the opposite of shame, but its source. True humility is the only antidote to shame.",祖子王子，骄傲不是羞耻的反面，而是它的来源。真正的谦卑是羞耻的唯一解药。
Zuko,"Well, my life has been nothing but humbling lately.",好吧，我的生活最近只是谦卑。
Iroh,"I have another idea. I will teach you a firebending move that even Azula doesn't know, because I made it up myself.",我有另一个想法。我会教你一个甚至Azula不知道的火灾动作，因为我自己做了。
Sokka,"You probably think I deserve this, don't you? Look, I'm sorry I hunted you, but that's just the natural order of things. Big things eat smaller things, nothing personal. But this time it didn't work out that way. I admit it ... you're cute. Okay, you convinced me, if I get out of this alive, it's a karmically correct, vegetarian existence for me. No meat. Even though meat is so tasty. Hey, looks like my karma is already paying off! That's okay, I got it. Now, come back boomerang.",你可能认为我应该得到这个，不是吗？看，我很抱歉我找你了，但这只是事情的自然顺序。大事吃小东西，没什么个人的。但这次它没有那么成功。我承认......你很可爱。好吧，你说服了我，如果我活着离开这个，那对我来说，这是一个正常的素食存在。没有肉。即使肉是如此美味。嘿，看起来我的业力已经得到了回报！没关系，我明白了。现在，回到回旋镖。
Katara,"You know this block you're having is only temporary, right?",你知道你所拥有的这块只是暂时的，对吧？
Aang,I don't want to talk about it.,我不想讨论这件事。
Katara,"You do realize that's the problem, don't you? If you face this issue instead of avoiding it–",你确实意识到这是问题，不是吗？如果你面对这个问题而不是避免 - 
Aang,"I know, I know, I know, I know! I get it, all right? I need to face it head on like a rock, but I just can't do it. I don't know why I can't, but I can't.",我知道，我知道，我知道，我知道！我明白了，好吗？我需要像岩石一样面对它，但我不能这样做。我不知道为什么我不能，但我不能。
Katara,"Aang, if fire and water are opposites, then what's the opposite of air?",Aang，如果火和水是对立的，那么空气的反面是什么？
Aang,I guess it's earth.,我想这是地球。
Katara,That's why it's so difficult for you to get this. You're working with your natural opposite. But you'll figure it out. I know you will. Think fast! Excellent. You have the reflexes of a waterbending master.,这就是为什么你很难得到这个。你正在与自然相反。但你会明白的。我知道你会的。快速思考！优秀。你有一个waterbending大师的反应。
Aang,"Thanks, Katara. Sifu Katara.",谢谢，卡塔拉。免费送货。
Iroh,"Fire is the element of power. The people of the Fire Nation have desire and will, and the energy to drive and achieve what they want. Earth is the element of substance. The people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse and strong. They are persistent and enduring. Air is the element of freedom. The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom. Also, they apparently had pretty good senses of humor! Water is the element of change. The people of the Water Tribe are capable of adapting to many things. They have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything.",火是力量的元素。消防国家的人民有欲望和意志，以及驱动和实现他们想要的东西的能量。地球是物质的要素。地球王国的人民多样而强大。它们具有持久性和持久性。空气是自由的要素。空中游牧民族脱离了世俗的关切，找到了和平与自由。而且，他们显然有很好的幽默感！水是变化的要素。水部落的人民能够适应很多事情。他们有一种深刻的社区和爱的感觉，通过任何东西将他们团结在一起。
Zuko,Why are you telling me these things?,你为什么要告诉我这些事情？
Iroh,"It is important to draw wisdom from many different places. If you take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale. Understanding others, the other elements, and the other nations will help you become whole.",从许多不同的地方吸取智慧是很重要的。如果你只从一个地方拿走它，那就变得僵硬和陈旧。了解他人，其他元素和其他国家将帮助你变得完整。
Zuko,All this four elements talk is sounding like Avatar stuff.,所有这四个元素的谈话听起来都像阿凡达的东西。
Iroh,"It is the combination of the four elements in one person that makes the Avatar so powerful. But it can make you more powerful, too. You see the technique I'm about to teach you is one I learned by studying the waterbenders.",它是一个人的四个元素的组合，使阿凡达如此强大。但它也可以让你更强大。你会看到我要教给你的技术是我通过研究水基而学到的。
Toph,"Aang, I found these nuts in your bag. I figured you wouldn't mind. And besides, even if you did, you're too much of a pushover to do anything about it.",Aang，我在你的包里发现了这些坚果。我想你不会介意的。而且，即使你这样做了，你也不会做任何关于它的事情。
Aang,"As a matter of fact, I don't mind. I'm happy to share anything I have.",事实上，我不介意。我很高兴与大家分享一切。
Toph,"You know, I'm really glad you feel that way. Because I also have this great new nutcracker.",你知道，我很高兴你有这种感觉。因为我也有这个伟大的新胡桃夹子。
Aang,"Actually, I prefer if you didn't ... That's an antique, handcrafted by the monks ... It's a delicate instrument!",实际上，如果你没有，我更喜欢......这是一个由僧侣手工制作的古董......这是一种精致的乐器！
Toph,It's not the only delicate instrument around here.,它不是这里唯一的精致仪器。
Aang,Ohm.,欧姆。
Katara,"Hey Aang, have you seen–",嘿，你见过 - 
Aang,Meditating here!,在这里冥想！
Katara,It's important. It's almost sundown and Sokka isn't back yet. I think we should search for him.,这一点很重要。这几乎是日落，Sokka还没回来。我想我们应该找他。
Aang,We'll find him faster if we split up.,如果我们分手，我们会发现他更快。
Sokka,"Okay, karma person or thing, whoever's in charge of this stuff. If I can just get out of this situation alive, I will give up meat and sarcasm. Okay? Ow! That's all I got. It's pretty much my whole identity. Sokka, the meat and sarcasm guy. But I'm willing to be Sokka, the veggies and straight talk fellow. Deal? Aang! Thank goodness! Have you got any meat?",好吧，业力人或事，无论谁掌管这些东西。如果我能活着摆脱这种情况，我会放弃肉食和讽刺。好的？噢！这就是我得到的。这几乎是我的全部身份。 Sokka，肉和讽刺的家伙。但我愿意成为Sokka，蔬菜和直言不讳的人。交易吗？阿昂！谢天谢地！你有肉吗？
Aang,Sokka! Are you okay?,Sokka！你还好吗？
Sokka,"Aggh, stop, stop! You're going to pull my fingers off and I don't think the rest of me is coming!",阿格，停下来，停下来！你要拉开我的手指，我不认为我的其他人会来！
Aang,Hmmm ... I bet I can airbend you out of here.,嗯......我敢打赌，我可以把你从这里赶走。
Sokka,"Seriously Aang, I know you're new at it, but I could use a little earthbending here. How about it?",严重的是Aang，我知道你是新手，但我可以在这里使用一点土地。这个怎么样？
Aang,I can't ... I can't do it.,我不能......我不能这样做。
Sokka,"Well, if you can't earthbend me out of here, go get Toph.",好吧，如果你不能把我从这里弄出来，去吧Toph。
Aang,I can't do that either.,我也做不到。
Sokka,You can't? Why not?,你不能？为什么不？
Aang,It would just be really ... uncomfortable.,它会真的......不舒服。
Sokka,"Uncomfortable? Well, I wouldn't want you to feel uncomfortable ...",不舒服？好吧，我不希望你感到不舒服......
Aang,"Thanks, Sokka. This whole earthbending thing really has me confused. There's so much pressure. Everyone expects me to get it right away. It puts me in a really awkward position.",谢谢，Sokka。整个地球怪物真的让我感到困惑。压力太大了。每个人都希望我立刻得到它。这让我处于一个非常尴尬的境地。
Sokka,"Awkward position, I think I know the feeling.",尴尬的位置，我想我知道这种感觉。
Aang,"If I try, I fail. If I don't try, I'm never going to get it. I feel like I'm caught between a rock and a hard place.",如果我尝试，我会失败。如果我不尝试，我永远不会得到它。我觉得自己陷入了困境之中。
Sokka,"Hmmm ... how about that. Aang, this is my friend, Foo Foo Cuddlypoops. Foo Foo Cuddlypoops, Aang.",嗯......怎么样。 Aang，这是我的朋友，Foo Foo Cuddlypoops。 Foo Foo Cuddlypoops，Aang。
Aang,"Awww, what a cute name for a baby saber-tooth moose-lion cub.",Awww，这是一个可爱的名字，一个婴儿剑齿驼鹿狮子幼崽。
Sokka,Really? He looks nothing like a saber-tooth moose-lion.,真？他看起来不像是一把剑齿麋狮。
Aang,It's hard to tell before their giant teeth and horns grow in. What are you doing out here little guy? Did you lose your mama?,在他们巨大的牙齿和角落生长之前很难说出来。你在这里做什么小家伙？你失去了妈妈吗？
Iroh,"Waterbenders deal with the flow of energy. A waterbender lets their defense become their offense, turning their opponents' energy against them. I learned a way to do this with lightning.",Waterbenders处理能量流动。 waterbender让他们的防守成为他们的进攻，将他们的对手的能量转向他们。我学会了用闪电做到这一点的方法。
Zuko,You can teach me to redirect lightning?,你可以教我重定向闪电吗？
Iroh,"If you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it. You must create a pathway from your fingertips, up your arm to your shoulder, then down into your stomach. The stomach is the source of energy in your body. It is called the sea of chi. Only in my case it is more like a vast ocean. From the stomach, you direct it up again, and out the other arm. The stomach detour is critical. You must not let the lightning pass through your heart, or the damage could be deadly. You may wish to try a physical motion, to get a feel for the pathways' flow, like this. Now, are you focusing your energy? Can you feel your own chi flowing in, down, up, and out?",如果你让自己体内的能量流动，闪电就会跟随它。你必须从指尖创建一条通路，从手臂到肩膀，再到胃部。胃是你体内的能量来源。它被称为chi之海。只有在我的情况下，它更像是一片广阔的海洋。从胃部，你再次引导它，从另一只手臂引出。胃迂回是至关重要的。你不能让闪电穿过你的心脏，否则伤害可能是致命的。您可能希望尝试一下物理运动，以感受通路的流动，就像这样。现在，你是否专注于精力？你能感觉到自己的智能流入，流下，流出和流出吗？
Zuko,I think so.,我认同。
Iroh,"Come on, you've got to feel the flow. Excellent! You've got it!",来吧，你必须感受到流动。优秀！你懂了！
Zuko,"Great, I'm ready to try it with real lightning!",太好了，我准备用真正的闪电来试试吧！
Iroh,"What, are you crazy? Lightning is very dangerous!",你疯了吗？闪电是非常危险的！
Zuko,I thought that was the point! You teaching me to protect myself from it!,我认为那就是重点！你教我保护自己免受它伤害！
Iroh,"Yeah! But I'm not going to shoot lightning at you! If you're lucky, you will never have to use this technique at all!",是啊！但是我不会向你开枪！如果你很幸运，你将永远不必使用这种技术！
Zuko,"Well, if you won't help me, I'll find my own lightning.",好吧，如果你不帮助我，我会找到自己的闪电。
Aang,"Hey there, we found your cub! See, we have no problem with you! We're friendly!",嘿，我们找到了你的幼仔！看，我们对你没有问题！我们很友好！
Sokka,"Aang, this is bad, you've got to get me out of here!",Aang，这很糟糕，你必须让我离开这里！
Sokka,"This is really bad! Please Aang, you have to earthbend me out, there's no other way!",这真的很糟糕！请Aang，你必须把我弄出来，别无他法！
Aang,"Oh no! Woo-hoo, look at me!",不好了！呜呜，看着我！
Sokka,"Please, don't leave me again.",拜托，请不要再离开我了。
Aang,I won't.,我不会。
Sokka,What are you doing here?,你在这里做什么？
Toph,Just enjoying the show.,只是欣赏节目。
Aang,What? You were there the whole time?,什么？你一直在那里吗？
Toph,Pretty much.,差不多。
Aang,Why didn't you do something? Sokka was in trouble! I was in trouble! You could have gotten him out and helped us get away!,你为什么不做点什么？索卡陷入困境！我遇到了麻烦！你本可以让他出去帮助我们逃脱！
Toph,Guess it just didn't occur to me.,猜猜它没发生在我身上。
Aang,Enough! I want my staff back!,足够！我希望我的员工回来！
Toph,Do it now!,现在做！
Aang,What?,什么？
Toph,"Earthbend, Twinkle Toes. You just stood your ground against a crazy beast. And even more impressive, you stood your ground against me. You've got stuff.",Earthbend，Twinkle Toes。你只是站在一个疯狂的野兽面前。更令人印象深刻的是，你坚持不懈地反对我。你有东西。
Aang,But–,但-
Toph,Do it!,做吧！
Toph,You did it! You're an earthbender.,你做到了！你是地球人。
Aang,I can't believe it!,我简直不敢相信！
Sokka,"Awww, this is a really wonderful, touching moment. So could you get me out of here so I can give you both a big, snuggly hug?",Awww，这是一个非常精彩，感人的时刻。所以你能让我离开这里，所以我可以给你一个大而舒适的拥抱吗？
Aang,"No problem, Sokka!",没问题，Sokka！
Toph,"Actually, you should probably let me do that. You're still a little new to this. You might accidentally crush him.",实际上，你应该让我这样做。你还有点新鲜。你可能会不小心碾碎他。
Sokka,"Yeah, no crushing, please.",是的，请不要碾碎。
Katara,You found him!,你找到了他！
Sokka,"The whole time, I was in that hole, not knowing if I was going to live or die. It makes a man to think about what's really important. I realized–",一直以来，我都在那个洞里，不知道我是要活着还是死去。它让人想到什么才是真正重要的。我意识到-
Aang,"Hey Katara, look what I can do!",嘿卡塔拉，看看我能做些什么！
Katara,"You did it! I knew you would! You tried the positive reinforcement, didn't you?",你做到了！我知道你会的！你试过积极的强化，不是吗？
Toph,"Yep, it worked wonders.",是的，它创造了奇迹。
Aang,"Appa, Appa, I can earthbend now! The key is being completely rooted. Physically and mentally unmovable!",Appa，Appa，我现在可以做土地了！关键是完全扎根。在身体和精神上不可动摇！
Zuko,"You've always thrown everything you could at me! Well, I can take it, and now I can give it back! Come on, strike me! You've never held back before!",你总是把一切都扔给我！好吧，我可以接受它，现在我可以把它还给我！来吧，打我！你以前从未退缩过！
