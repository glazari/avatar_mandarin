Storyteller,"So, travelers. The next time you think you hear a strange, large bird talking, take a closer look. It might not be a giant parrot, but a flying man. A member of a secret group of air walkers, who laugh at gravity, and laugh at those bound to the earth by it!",所以，旅行者。下次当你认为你听到一只奇怪的大鸟说话时，仔细看看。它可能不是一只巨大的鹦鹉，而是一个飞行的人。一群秘密的空中步行者，嘲笑引力，嘲笑那些被地球束缚的人！

Aang,What are you doing? Who said you could be here?,你在做什么？谁说你可能在这里？
Mechanist,"Hmm, doing here ... A long time ago, but not a hundred years, my people became refugees after a terrible flood. My infant son, Teo, was badly hurt and lost his mother. I needed somewhere to rebuild and I stumbled across this place. Couldn't believe it! Everywhere! Pictures of flying people! But empty, nobody home. Then, I came across these fan-like contraptions!",嗯，在这里做......很久以前，但不是一百年，我的人民在经历了可怕的洪水之后变成了难民。我的小儿子Teo受了重伤，失去了母亲。我需要某处重建，我偶然发现了这个地方。简直不敢相信！到处！飞人的图片！但空虚，没有人回家。然后，我遇到了这些粉丝般的装置！
Aang,Our gliders.,我们的滑翔机。
Mechanist,"Yes! Little, light flying machines! They gave me an idea. Build a new life for my son, in the air! Then everyone will be on equal ground! So to speak.

Mechanist,"I suppose that's true. Unfortunately, progress has a way of getting away from us. Look at the time! Come! The pulley system must be oiled before dark.",我想这是真的。不幸的是，进步有一种远离我们的方式。看看时间！来！滑轮系统必须在天黑前加油。

Mechanist,The candle will tell us. Watch.,蜡烛会告诉我们。看。
Sokka,You put spark powder in the candle!,你把火花粉放在蜡烛里！

Aang,I just can't get over it. There's not a single thing that's the same.,我无法克服它。没有一件事情是一样的。
Teo,I don't know about that. The temple might be different but the creatures that live here are probably direct descendants of the ones who lived here a long time ago.,我不知道。寺庙可能不同，但居住在这里的生物很可能是很久以前住在这里的人的直系后裔。

Katara,Aang?,阿昂？
Aang,I'm sorry. This is the last part of the temple that's the same as it was. I want it to stay that way.,对不起。这是寺庙的最后一部分，与现在一样。我希望它保持这种状态。
Teo,I completely understand. I just wanted you to know that it's here.,我完全明白。我只是想让你知道它就在这里。
Aang,Thanks.,谢谢。
Sokka,These lanterns are terrible. I can't see! Why would you want to use fireflies for light?,这些灯笼太可怕了。我看不到！你为什么要用萤火虫照明？

Mechanist,Cover your nose and hold your breath.,捂住鼻子，屏住呼吸。
Sokka,Okay ... so you brought me all the way down here to see an empty room.,好的...所以你把我带到这里看到一个空房间。
Mechanist,"Wrong. It's filled to the brim with natural gas. Came across it my first time here. Unfortunately, I was carrying a torch at the time. Nearly blew my self and the whole place even more sky high! Thought my eyebrows would never grow back. Anyway, there's a vital problem that needs solving. From time to time, we have gas leaks. And they're nearly impossible to find.",错误。它充满了天然气。我第一次来到这里。不幸的是，当时我带着火炬。几乎把自己和整个地方吹得更高了！我以为我的眉毛永远不会再回来了。无论如何，这是一个需要解决的重要问题。我们不时有煤气泄漏。他们几乎不可能找到。

Mechanist,"Yes, until I figure out how to locate something I can't see, hear, smell, or touch.",是的，直到我弄清楚如何找到我看不见，听不见，闻不到或触摸的东西。

Katara,"Teo was right about the air. All I had to do was trust it, let it carry me.",Teo对空气是正确的。我所要做的只是相信它，让它带给我。
Aang,"Even though Teo's not an airbender, he really does have the spirit of one! I've been thinking. If you want to see what's in that room, I'd be happy to open the door for you.",虽然Teo不是一个气球运动员，但他确实有一个精神！我一直在想。如果你想看看那个房间里有什么，我很乐意为你打开门。

I did this for you!",我们搬到这里差不多一年了。消防国家士兵找到了我们的定居点。你太年轻了，不记得这个，Teo。他们要破坏一切！把它烧到地上！我恳求他们，我求他们饶了我们！他们问我要提供什么。我提供了......我的服务。你必须明白。我为你做了这个！

Sokka,Thank you. You're a genius!,谢谢。你是个天才！
Mechanist,Thank you!,谢谢！
Sokka,"See, the problem with the old war balloon was you could get it air-borne, but once it did, it just kept going. You could put a hole in the top, but then all the hot air would escape. So the question became, how do you keep a lid on hot air?",看，旧战争气球的问题是你可以通过空中传播，但一旦它做到了，它就会继续下去。你可以在顶部放一个洞，然后所有的热空气都会逃逸。所以问题就变成了，你怎么盖上热空气？
Katara,"Ugh, if only we knew.",呃，只要我们知道。
