But fire will spread and destroy everything in its path if one does not have the will to control it! That is its destiny! You are not ready! You are too weak!",你聋了吗？如果你拒绝听，我该怎么教你？在学习防火之前，你必须学习水和土。水凉爽舒缓，土壤稳定稳定，但火，火还活着！它呼吸，它成长。如果没有弯曲机，岩石就不会自行抛掷！但是，如果一个人没有控制它的意志，火势就会蔓延并摧毁其中的一切！这就是它的命运！你还没有准备好！你太虚弱了！

Jeong Jeong,"I had a pupil once who had no interest in learning discipline.

Its nature is to consume and without control it destroys everything around it.",我曾经有一个学生没有兴趣学习纪律。他只关心火力 - 他怎么能用它来摧毁他的对手并消灭他路上的障碍，但火灾是一种可怕的负担。它的本质是消耗而不受控制，它会摧毁周围的一切。

Katara,But you're a great master. You have powers that I will never know.,但你是一位伟大的大师。你拥有我永远不会知道的力量。
