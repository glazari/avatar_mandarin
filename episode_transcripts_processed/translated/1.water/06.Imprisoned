Fake earthbending.",起初我觉得你很疯狂，卡塔拉，但这可能会奏效。这些矿井都有通风井。所有Aang所要做的就是从这个通风口向这个通风口输送气流。巨石漂浮和ta-da！假地球弯曲。

So, if you have any illusions about employing that brutish savagery that passes for bending among you people ... forget them. It is impossible. Good day.",你会注意到，这个钻机完全由金属制成。你距离任何岩石或地球都很远。所以，如果你对使用那种在你们中间弯曲的野蛮野蛮人有任何幻想......忘了他们。是不可能的。美好的一天。

And it is your courage they should truly fear! Because it runs deeper than any mine you've been forced to dig, any ocean that keeps you far from home! It is the strength of your hearts that make you who you are. Hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has eroded away. The time to fight back is now! I can tell you the Avatar has returned! So remember your courage earthbenders, let us fight for our freedom!",Earthbenders！你不认识我，但我知道你。水族部落村里的每个孩子都沉浸在勇敢的地球王国的故事和守卫其边界的勇敢的地球上。你们中的一些人可能会认为火国让你无能为力。是的，他们已经剥夺了你弯腰的能力。但他们无法带走你的勇气。他们应该真正害怕你的勇气！因为它比你被迫挖掘的任何矿井都要深，所以任何让你远离家乡的海洋！这是你心中的力量，使你成为自己。当所有的岩石和石头都被侵蚀掉时，它们将保持不间断。现在是时候反击了！我可以告诉你阿凡达已经回来了！所以请记住你的勇气，让我们为自由而战！

Sokka,"It should. These vents reminded me of our little trick back at the village. We're gonna do the same thing, but on a much bigger scale. There's a huge deposit of coal at the base of the silo. And the whole system is ventilated. Aang closed off all the vents except one. When he does his airbending the coal only has one place to go, right back here.",这应该。这些通风口让我想起了我们在村里的小动作。我们会做同样的事情，但规模要大得多。在筒仓的底部有一大堆煤炭。整个系统都是通风的。除了一个，Aang关闭了所有的通风口。当他做空气动力时，煤炭只有一个地方可以去，就在这里。
