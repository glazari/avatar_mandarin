Aang,"Hi hi hi! Ha, ha, ha!",你好！哈哈哈！
Katara,I haven't done this since I was a kid!,我从小就没这样做过！
Aang,You still are a kid!,你还是个孩子！
Aang,Whoa! What is that?,哇！那是什么？
Katara,"A Fire Navy ship. And a very bad memory for my people. Aang, stop! We're not allowed to go near it! The ship could be booby-trapped!",一艘火海军舰。对我的人来说，这是一段非常糟糕的回忆Aang，停！我们不被允许靠近它！这艘船可能陷入困境！

Katara,This ship has haunted my tribe since Gran-Gran was a little girl. It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks.,自Gran-Gran还是一个小女孩以来，这艘船一直困扰着我的部落。这是Fire Nation首次攻击的一部分。

Katara,"Come on, let's get out of here.",来吧，让我们离开这里。
Katara,"Aang, let's head back, this place is creepy.",Aang，让我们回头，这个地方令人毛骨悚然。
Aang,Huh?,咦？
Aang,What's that you said about booby traps?,你说的关于诱杀陷阱的是什么？
