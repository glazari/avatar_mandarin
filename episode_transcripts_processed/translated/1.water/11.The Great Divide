Gan Jin leader,Gladly.,乐意。

See if you can find out why they hate each other so much.",足够！我想我可以帮助你们相处，但我猜这不会发生。我们应该分开，这边是甘金和那边的张。我们将分两行旅行。 Sokka，你和Zhangs和Katara一起去，你和Gan Jins一起去。看看你是否能找到他们互相讨厌的原因。

Sokka,"Finally, someone gets it!",最后，有人得到它！

Gan Jin leader,"No, but you can never be too careful, right?",不，但你永远不能太小心吧？

Gan Jin leader,"You seem like a smart girl Katara, I bet you would enjoy hearing some history. The patriarch of our tribe, Jin Wei, was an earthbender warrior who was assigned an important duty, transporting our sacred orb from the great eastern gate, to the great western gate. Taking the orb from the east to the west represents the sun's rising and setting. It was our tribe's ancient redemption ritual. But as he approached the gate, Jin Wei was attacked by one of the Zhang, a vermin named Wei Jin, who looked at the orb with envy. That coward Wei Jin knocked Jin Wei to the ground, and stole our sacred orb. Our people have never forgotten. You can never trust a Zhang.",你看起来像一个聪明的女孩卡塔拉，我打赌你会喜欢听到一些历史。我们部落的族长金伟是一位地球战士，他被赋予了重要的职责，将我们神圣的宝珠从大东门运到大西门。从东到西的球体表示太阳升起和落下。这是我们部落古老的救赎仪式。但当他走近大门时，金伟遭到一名叫魏晋的害虫张某的袭击，他惊恐地看着这颗球。懦夫魏晋将金伟撞倒在地，并偷走了我们神圣的宝珠。我们的人民永远不会忘记。你永远不能相信张。

Sokka,Would I!,我可以吗！
Zhang leader,"I know what you must be thinking, we're horrible for endangering everybody by bringing food down here.",我知道你一定在想什么，我们通过把食物带到这里来危害每个人都是可怕的。
Sokka,Hm-hmm.,嗯。
Zhang leader,"The Gan Jin think so badly of us, they probably assumed we brought food in and decided to bring food in themselves. That's why we brought food in.",甘瑾对我们的看法非常糟糕，他们可能认为我们带来了食物，并决定自己带食物。这就是我们带来食物的原因。
Sokka,Hmm.,嗯。
Zhang leader,"Our conflict with the Gan Jin goes back over a hundred years. Our forefather Wei Jin was leaving the western gate of our village, when he saw a figure in the distance. It was a man of the Gan Jin tribe, Jin Wei, collapsed on the ground. Noble Wei Jin stopped to help him. Jin Wei was transporting a sacred orb, a very powerful relic used in his tribe's redemption ritual. Wei Jin tried to tend to the man's wounds but Jin Wei insisted the orb was more important, and asked him to take it back to his tribe. Kind Wei Jin promised to send help for the man as soon as he could, but as Wei Jin crossed the border to return the orb into Gan Jin territory, he was arrested. Instead of thanking him for his kind and selfless deed, they sentenced him to twenty long years in prison. We Zhangs will never forget that injustice.",我们与甘金的冲突可以追溯到一百多年前。当我看到远处的一个人物时，我们的祖先魏晋离开了我们村的西门。这是甘金部落的一名男子，金伟倒在地上。高贵的魏晋停下来帮助他。金薇正在运送一个神圣的圆球，这是一个非常强大的遗物，用于他的部落的救赎仪式。魏晋试图倾向于男人的伤口，但金伟坚持认为球更重要，并要求他把它带回他的部落。善良的魏晋答应尽快向这名男子提供帮助，但随着魏晋越过边界将该球返回甘瑾地区，他被捕。他们没有感谢他善良无私的行为，而是将他判处二十年徒刑。我们张永远不会忘记这种不公正。
Sokka,That's just terrible. You gonna finish that?,那太可怕了。你会完成那个吗？
Aang,"Sure would be nice to be sitting around one of those campfires, telling stories and laughing. Its okay Momo, we'll be out of here soon enough, and then we can eat our weight in leechi nuts! Nah, I'll wait for the leechi nuts.",当然可以坐在其中一个篝火旁，讲故事和大笑。它没关系Momo，我们很快就会离开这里，然后我们可以用leechi坚果来减肥！不，我会等leechi坚果。
Canyon guide,"Lonely isn't it, being impartial?",孤独不是它，是不偏不倚的？
Aang,"I wish I could help these people get along, but it just seems impossible. Anyhow, I guess our biggest problem is getting out of here.",我希望我可以帮助这些人相处，但这似乎是不可能的。无论如何，我想我们最大的问题就是离开这里。
Canyon guide,I'm not so sure the two problems are unrelated.,我不太确定这两个问题是无关的。
Canyon guide,"All clear, we're almost to the other side.",一切都清楚，我们几乎到了另一边。
Aang,"Katara, Sokka, will these people cooperate long enough to get out of the canyon?",Sokka的Katara，这些人会合作足够长的时间离开峡谷吗？
Katara,"I don't think so, Aang, the Zhangs really wronged the Gan Jins. They ambushed Jin Wei and stole the sacred orb.",我不这么认为，Aang，Zhangs真的冤枉了Gan Jins。他们伏击金威并偷走了神圣的宝珠。
Aang,What are you talking about?,你在说什么？
Sokka,"Yeah Katara, what are you talking about? Wei Jin didn't steal the orb, he was returning it to their village gate and was wrongfully punished by the Gan Jin.",是啊卡塔拉，你在说什么？魏晋没有偷走这个球，他把它送回了他们的村门，被甘瑾惩罚了。
Katara,Not punished enough if you ask me.,如果你问我，不要受到足够的惩罚。
Aang,"Okay, okay I get it! Now I need your help, I need everyone together at the base of the canyon wall. Please everyone, as soon as we get out of here we can eat and then go our separate ways, but I need you all to put your heads together and figure out a way up this cliff.","好的，好吧，我明白了！现在我需要你的帮助，我需要大家一起在峡谷墙的底部。请大家，一旦我们离开这里，我们就可以吃饭，然后分道扬,,但我需要你们大家齐心协力，想出一条悬崖。"
Gan Jin leader,Maybe the Zhang can climb the wall with their long disgusting fingernails.,也许张可以用长长的令人厌恶的指甲爬上墙。
Zhang leader,"Oh sorry, I forgot that to the Gan Jin unclipped fingernails is a crime punishable by twenty years in jail!",哦对不起，我忘记了，对于甘金未经剪下的指甲是一种可以在监狱中被判处二十年徒刑的罪行！
Gan Jin leader,"Why, you dirty thief!",为什么，你这个肮脏的小偷！
Zhang leader,You pompous fool!,你这个浮夸的笨蛋！
Aang,"Guys, focus! How many times do I have to say it? Harsh words won't solve problems, action will!",伙计们，专注！我有多少次说出来？苛刻的话语不会解决问题，行动会！
Zhang leader,Perhaps the Avatar is right.,也许阿凡达是对的。
Gan Jin leader,"Yes, perhaps he is.",是的，也许他是。
Zhang leader,Harsh words will never solve our problems.,苛刻的话永远无法解决我们的问题。
Gan Jin leader,Action will!,行动会！
Gan Jin leader,To the death! And let this be the end of this rivalry!,到死！让这成为这场竞争的终结！
Aang,"You know, I take it back. Harsh words aren't so bad!",你知道，我把它拿回来。苛刻的话语并不是那么糟糕！
Aang,Is that ... food? Everyone smuggled food down here? Unbelievable! You guys put our lives in danger because you couldn't go without a snack for a day? You're all awful! So hungry. Is that an egg custard in that tart?,那是......食物吗？每个人都在这里走私食物？难以置信的！你们因为一天不吃零食而把我们的生命置于危险境地？你太可怕了！好饿这是一个蛋羹吗？
Katara,"Oh no, that's a lot of canyon crawlers.",哦不，那是很多峡谷爬虫。
Sokka,We barely survived one!,我们勉强幸存下来！
Canyon guide,They're coming back for me! They've had a taste and they're coming back for me!,他们回来给我了！他们有品味，他们会回来给我！
Katara,"Sokka, wait. I don't care about this stupid feud, I just want us to get out of here alive.",索卡，等等。我不在乎这种愚蠢的不和，我只是想让我们活着离开这里。
Sokka,Me too. I only took their side 'cause they fed me.,我也是。我只是站在他们一边，因为他们喂我。
Aang,"Everybody, watch me and do what I do! Now follow me! We're riding out of this hole! Everyone, get off!",每个人，看着我，做我做的事！现在跟我来！我们正在走出这个洞！大家好，下车！
Zhang leader,We made it!,我们做到了！
Zhang leader,I never thought a Gan Jin could get his hands dirty like that.,我从未想过甘瑾能像那样弄脏手。
Gan Jin leader,And I never knew you Zhangs were so reliable in a pinch.,而且我从来不知道张在这么紧张的时候是如此可靠。
Zhang leader,Perhaps we're not so different after all.,也许我们毕竟没那么不同。
Gan Jin leader,Too bad we can't rewrite history. You thieves stole our sacred orb from Jin Wei!,太糟糕了，我们无法改写历史。你小偷偷走了金威的神圣宝珠！
Zhang leader,You tyrants unjustly imprisoned Wei Jin for twenty long years!,你的暴君不公正地囚禁了魏晋二十年！
Aang,Wait a second ... Jin Wei? Wei Jin? I know those guys!,等一下......金薇？魏进？我认识那些家伙！
Gan Jin leader,"Yes, yes, we're all aware of the story.",是的，是的，我们都知道这个故事。
Aang,"No, I mean I really knew them. I might not look it, but I'm a hundred and twelve years old. I was there one hundred years ago on the day you're talking about. There seems to be a lot of confusion about what happened. First of all, Jin Wei and Wei Jin weren't enemies. They were brothers, twins in fact, and they were eight; and most importantly, they were just playing a game! The sacred orb from the legend, that was the ball! And the eastern and western gates were the goal posts. Jin Wei had the ball and was running toward the goal when he fell and fumbled it. Wei Jin didn't steal the ball, he picked it up and started running it toward the other goal, but he stepped out of bounds, so the official put him in the penalty box. Not for twenty long years but for two short minutes. There was no stealing and no putting anyone in imprison, it was just a game.",不，我的意思是我真的了解他们。我可能不会看，但我已经一百一十二岁了。在你谈论的那一天，我在一百年前就在那里。关于发生的事情似乎有很多混乱。首先，金威和魏晋不是敌人。事实上他们是兄弟，双胞胎，他们八岁;最重要的是，他们只是在玩游戏！传说中的神圣宝珠，就是球！东西大门是球门柱。当他摔倒并且摸索着时，Jin Wei拿到了球并朝着球门跑去。魏晋没有偷球，他把球拿起来开始向另一个球门跑去，但是他走出界外，所以这位官员把他放进禁区。不是二十年，而是两分钟。没有偷窃，没有任何人被关押，这只是一场比赛。
Zhang leader,You're saying the sacred orb was actually a sacred ball?,你是说神圣的球体实际上是一个神圣的球​​？
Aang,"Nope, just a regular ball.",不，只是一个普通的球。
Gan Jin man,What about our tribe's redemption ritual?,我们部落的救赎仪式怎么样？
Aang,"That's what the game was called, redemption. As soon as you got the ball from one end to the other, everyone would yell ""redemption""! Don't get me wrong, Wei Jin was kind of a slob and Jin Wei was a little stuffy, that much is true. But they respected each other's differences enough to share the same playing field.",这就是游戏的召唤，赎回。一旦你从一端拿到球到另一端，每个人都会喊“救赎”！不要误会我的意思，魏晋有点邋and，金薇有点闷，这是真的。但他们尊重彼此的差异，足以分享同样的竞争环境。
Zhang leader,I suppose it's time we forget the past.,我想是时候忘记过去了。
Gan Jin leader,And look to the future.,展望未来。
Aang,"Good to see you, boy. Did you miss me?",很高兴见到你，男孩。你想念我吗？
Gan Jin leader,"I cannot thank you enough, Avatar.",我不能够感谢你，阿凡达。
Aang,"Well, you know I try.",嗯，你知道我试试。
Gan Jin leader,Ugh!,啊!
Zhang leader,Let us travel to the Earth Kingdom capital as one tribe.,让我们作为一个部落前往地球王国首都。
Canyon guide,I'm going too! I'm sick of this place!,我也去了！我厌倦了这个地方！

Sokka,What?,什么？
Aang,I made the whole thing up.,我完成了所有事情。
Katara,You did not! That is so wrong.,你没有！那是错的。
Aang,Now where is that egg custard tart? I'm starving!,那个鸡蛋蛋挞在哪里？我饿死了！
