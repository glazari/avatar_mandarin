Zuko would have to duel his own father.",那就对了。 Zuko看着他侮辱的老将军并宣称他并不害怕。但Zuko误解了。当他转身面对对手时，他惊讶地发现这不是将军。 Zuko已经反对将军的计划，但是在Fire Lord的战争室里这样做，那是他不尊重的火神。 Zuko将不得不与自己的父亲决斗。

Iroh,"It was no accident. After the duel, the Fire Lord said that by refusing to fight, Zuko had shown shameful weakness. As punishment, he was banished and sent to capture the Avatar. Only then could he return with his honor.",这不是偶然的。在决斗之后，火主说，拒绝战斗，Zuko表现出可耻的弱点。作为惩罚，他被驱逐并被派去夺取阿凡达。只有这样，他才能以他的名义回归。
Jee,So that's why he's so obsessed. Capturing the Avatar is the only chance he has of things returning to normal.,所以这就是他如此着迷的原因。捕获阿凡达是他恢复正常的唯一机会。
Iroh,Things will never return to normal. But the important thing is the Avatar gives Zuko hope.,事情永远不会恢复正常。但重要的是阿凡达给了Zuko希望。
